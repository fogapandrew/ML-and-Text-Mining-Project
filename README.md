# Machine Learning and Text Mining Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning and text mining project, completed as part of a coursework. The project applies both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, as well as text mining methods, on various datasets to address real-world problems. The work is divided into two main tasks: Machine Learning and Text Mining, each with its own subsections.

## Task 1: Supervised Machine Learning

### 1A. Classification Task

#### Objective:
The goal is to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast the death event of patients based on their clinical records, particularly focusing on serum creatinine and ejection fraction.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used comprises medical records of 299 patients who experienced heart failure, collected during a follow-up period. It includes 13 clinical features per patient, such as age, anemia status, serum creatinine levels, and whether the patient died during the follow-up period.

#### Process:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Initial data exploration, handling of missing values, and outlier treatment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.
- **Model Building**: Three models were trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation and Comparison**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the models. The Random Forest model emerged as the best performer.

### 1B. Regression Task

#### Objective:
To predict the diagnosis (normal or altered) based on various socio-demographic and health-related features using regression techniques.

#### Dataset:
The dataset consists of semen analysis data from 100 volunteers, focusing on factors like age, smoking habits, and history of childhood diseases.

#### Process:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Handling categorical data and outliers, ensuring no missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying correlations and distributions of features.
- **Model Building**: Regression models were trained to predict continuous target variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of model performance based on different metrics.

## Task 2: Text Mining (To be detailed based on additional information)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of machine learning and text mining techniques to real-world datasets, providing insights into the data and building models that can be used for predictive analytics.
